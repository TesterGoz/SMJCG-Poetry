Teamwork!


It seems solitude won't help us grow
It obviously hasn't worked before
Why not depend on each other?
There's always something more

Take my hand, teamwork never fails
I promise we won't lose each other
We'll discover all what this entails
And experience happiness within ourselves

"We need each other to succeed."
